#### Creating checkpoints

To create checkpoints, flip the toggle switch labeled "Click to
Create", and click in the map where you would like to create
checkpoints.

Once you have created one, you may name & and describe it right away,
or do so later.

#### Removing checkpoints

To delete a checkpoint, click on it, and press the "Remove" button on
the left.  This will cause the checkpoint to show up as red, with an X
in it.  To make it go away for good, save the course.  You can also
un-delete an unsaved deletion by clicking on the checkpoint in the map
and clicking on "restore".

#### Moving checkpoints

Checkpoints can be moved by dragging them.

#### Naming checkpoints

To name and describe a checkpoint, click on it in the map and edit the
name and description in the left-hand side.
